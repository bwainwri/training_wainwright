## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true # ignore the code and don't run it
#| warning: false # whether or not to display warnings
#| message: false # whether or not to show diagnostic messages
#| include: false # code and the output
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Level 1 Header

This is regular plain text.

## Level 2 Header

Making a bulleted list

-   bullet 1
-   list item 2
-   three
    -   indented bullet item
    -   item whatever

1.  Numbered list
2.  list item 2
3.  list item 3

If i want *italics* I can add an asterics before and after or an *underscore* before and after

If I two **two** asterics before and after its **bold**

***three asterics before and after is bold and italics***

```{r important r code}
x <- 1+1
# within curly brackets organizes and names chunk but doesn't show up as title or anything
```

```{r}
# command option i for creating a code chunk on macs
```

| Col1 | Col2 | Col3 |

\^\^ To add this I stayed in the visual editor of quarto and went to insert \> citation and that makes it pretty in my html and creates a bibliography file and adds a references section to the bottom of my HTML.
